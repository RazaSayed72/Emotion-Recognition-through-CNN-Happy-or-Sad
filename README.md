# Emotion-Recognition-through-CNN-Happy-or-Sad
This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify facial expressions as "happy" or "sad." Using a labeled dataset of facial images, the model is trained to accurately predict emotions. The goal is to improve real-time emotion detection for applications in mental health, user experience, and social robotics.
